# Game-Section.io
This project features a collection of two classic web-based games: Tic-Tac-Toe and Stone-Paper-Scissor. The main page allows users to choose and play these games in full-screen mode, enhancing the gaming experience. Each game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and they are neatly organized within the project directory.
